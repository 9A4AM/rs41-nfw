## Power Supply
### Boost converter
The boost converter - probably `TPS61200` from Texas Instruments, is used in a standard circuit. It gets enabled via `Q501` P-MOSFET. `Q501` state can be changed via hardwired logic to switch the sonde power.

### LDOs
The same as previous revision.

### Hard wired logic
It is exactly the same, though an accurate description maybe useful for somebody.<br>
Previously mentioned `Q501` P-MOSFET is controlled via a smaller N-MOSFET `Q502`. The sonde is ON if the `Q502` has a HIGH state on the gate, and it powers off when the gate closes.<br>

The sonde can be switched on via NFC 13.56MHz carrier signal on it's coil, which sends a rectified signal to the `Q502` gate.<br>

The button `S501` on the bottom of the sonde can turn on the sonde via `R507` to bring the `Q502` gate to logic HIGH signal. The button status can also be checked with uC via `R509`/`R513`_`C524` voltage divider. The middle leg of the button voltage divider is connected to the uC IO `PA6`. The button voltage gets slightly higher when it's pressed.<br>

The battery voltage can be measured by the MCU via `R508`/`R512`_`C523` voltage divider. The middle leg of this divider is connected to the `PA5` pin of the MCU. <br>

Once the `Q502` gets a HIGH signal, it stays open via `R505`, which sends voltage from the battery to the MOSFET gate.<br>

The sonde can be turned OFF by setting `PA9` MCU pin HIGH, which opens `Q503` N-MOSFET, that shorts the `Q502` gate directly to the ground. This closes the `Q501` and with that the boost converter EN and VIN pins don't receive power anymore.


## Microcontroller
<p align="center">
<img src="./photos/rs41-rsm414_uC.png" alt="pcb - front photo" style="width:40%"/><br>
</p><br>

As you can already know, it is a new STMicroelectronics [**STM32L412RBT6**](https://eu.mouser.com/datasheet/2/389/stm32l412c8-1851177.pdf) in a LQFP64 package. <br>
Like the previous revision, many of the IOs containg RC (resistor-capacitor) low pass filters.

## Frontend
It is very similar to the previous version, please refer to the *radiosonde_hardware* repo.<br>

For now, I didn't have time to reverse engineer it, apart from searching the pins for the SPST switches and pullup pins (available on the uC connection schematic above).<br>

Only thing worth (for now) mentioning are the reference heating resistors on the cut-out part of the PCB. In my firmware, they are used to slightly heat up the board near it, which contains the 26MHz crystal. The fw contains some wild functions to control it, which is used to limit the radio losing PLL-lock at very low temperatures (this occured also on older boards, like [here](https://github.com/hexameron/RS41HUP?tab=readme-ov-file#warning:~:text=Some%20RS41s%20have,resetting%20the%20chip.) or [here](https://www.areg.org.au/archives/208844#:~:text=Payload%20Testing%20Results,and%209km%20altitude.)). The PLL-lock loss happens mainly on the RTTY modulation using faster than 45 baud rates (lock-loss on Horus TX mode was not observed) when the Si4032 and the crystal cool down below 0Â°C. The heating logic is described in the operation manual, but worth mentioning is that you could try to improve the heat transfer by mounting to the resistors something heat-conductive (warning - it must not conduct electricity or it will cause a short circuit), like a small thin insulated elastic copper plate.

## GPS
The GPS module in the new revision is the component that differs the most - this time it is a **uBlox M10050-KB** in a QFN28 package. The circuit around it seems like a standard implementation, with RF filters and probably an LNA chip, and standard coupling capacitors and RC low pass. <br>
The bad thing is that only official document I could find about it was [this leaflet](https://content.u-blox.com/sites/default/files/UBX-M10050-KB_ProductSummary_UBX-20017986.pdf) which doesn't seem to be a complete datasheet. <br>
Luckily, the circuit implementation isn't hard to understand, so the UART pins were obvious to find. They are located on the right side of the chip, with RC filters before plated holes to the other side of the PCB, connected to pin 16 of the GPS as RX and 17 as a GPX TX. This GPS UART interface is then connected to the `PB6` and `PB7` pins of the uC.

## Radio
Nearly the same as in the previous rev.<br>

It is a Silicon Labs **Si4032**. It uses the same 26MHz clock as the GPS module, so the RF frequency on the output is different then the one set in the registers. <br>
`desired_freq * 26/30 = output_freq`<br>
The register values can be calculated on [this site](https://www.makemehack.com/2020/12/how-to-change-the-tx-frequency-of-the-vaisala-rs41-radiosonde.html), altough the frequency calulation algorithm as already implemented in the firmware.

## Interfaces
### SPI flash
The SPI flash footprint is also available here like in the previous version, probably to be used with a military RS41-SGM edition, that features a Radio Silence Mode. More about it in the *radiosonde_hardware* document.

### XDATA port
The XDATA port is the same on all models, with the following pinout (schematic is a copy from the mentioned repo):
```
Pinout of XDATA connector                                    Pinout of connected ribbon cable
                 -------                                     
           GND  | o   o |  XDATA_RX(PB11)                    > 1  GND
                |       |                                      2  XDATA_RX(PB11)
XDATA_TX(PB10)  | o   o |  +3V_MCU                             3  XDATA_TX(PB10) 
               -        |                                      4  +3V_MCU
       V_Boost|   o   o |  VBAT                                5  V_Boost
               -        |                                      6  VBAT
       MCU_RST  | o   o |  SWCLK(PA14)                         7  MCU_RST
                |       |                                      8  SWCLK(PA14)
   SWDIO(PA13)  | o   o |  GND                                 9  SWDIO(PA13)
                 -------                                      10  GND
```

### Internal expansion connector
I only have the RS41-SG version (without additional pressure sensor board), so the PCBs only contain a footprint for soldering one. I bet that the pinout is the same, desciription can be found in the *radiosonde_hardware*.

### NFC interface
Besides the lack of the `C604` capacitor (but the footprint is still there?) the circuit looks the same as the one before. <br>
I had no luck for now to implement some decent protocol, because the board doesn't feature any NFC frontend (which means carrier OOK modulation for rx by the sonde and rfid load changing as a tx from sonde).<br>

The only thing that it is capable for now (via the hardware side) is that the sonde can be instantly turned ON on detection of the 13.56MHz RFID carrier. You can try this with your NFC-capable smartphone - just turn on the NFC function (the one for the RFID cards) and stick the back of your phone to the back of the sonde or somewhere near the coil on the bottom. The lights should turn ON and the sonde should start working.
